# KMAP-M Fit Functions

This folder contains both original MATLAB code for kinetic fitting (e.g., the Patlak plot) and wrapper functions that are designed to interact with the compiled MEX binaries for kinetic modeling with compartmental modeling (e.g. the two-tissue model). These wrapper functions abstract the complexity of directly working with the MEX binaries, providing a more user-friendly interface for inputting data and obtaining results.

## Files in This Folder

- **kfit_1tcm.m**  
   Wrapper function for fitting time-activity curves (TACs) using the one-tissue compartment model (2TCM). This function calls the compiled MEX binary `kfit_2tcm_mex_omp` to perform the actual optimization.
   - **Inputs**:  
     - `ct`: Measured TAC data.
     - `cp`: Plasma input function.
     - `scant`: Scan time data (start and end times in seconds).
     - `k0`: Initial kinetic parameters.
     - `opt`: Fitting options structure.
     - `wt`: Frame weights (optional).
     - `cwb`: Whole blood data (optional).
   - **Outputs**:  
     - `k`: Fitted kinetic parameters.
     - `cfit`: Fitted TAC curve.
     - `ctis`: Tissue response function (optional).

- **kfit_liver.m**  
   Wrapper function for fitting TACs using a liver model with seven parameters. This function calls the compiled MEX binary `kfit_liver_mex_omp` for optimization.
   - **Inputs**:

     - `cfit`: Fitted TAC curve.
     - `ctis`: Tissue response function (optional).

- **run_ParametricImage.m**  
   This function is a example to show how to generate parametric image with the kinetic models from KMAP package. This function currently use 'kfit_2tcm' to provide 0T/1T/2Ti models for TAC fitting but other models can also be included. 
   - **Inputs**: 
     - `dynImgInp`: path to input dynamic images.
     - `foldOut`: path to store output parametric images.
     - `fileBIF`: path to input function.
     - `Dopt`: Optional settings structure.

`Note`: This function requires an additional package 'PLOT_v1.0' which can be downloaded from https://wanglab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/code. The image data for testing this function can be obtained from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OWG0FMlhuZL3vnv_fswXSaqXo8_762_5?usp=drive_link. 

## Usage Instructions

Before using any of these wrapper functions, ensure that the compiled MEX binaries (e.g., `kfit_2tcm_mex_omp`, `kfit_liver_mex_omp`) are available in your MATLAB path. These binaries should have been compiled using the appropriate source files in the `KMAP-C/mex` directory.

**Note:** The folder `KMAP-C/mex` contains both the MEX files and their precompiled binaries for different operating systems.  
- **Precompiled Binaries**: The precompiled MEX binaries for Windows, Linux, and macOS are organized in separate subdirectories within `KMAP-C/mex`. Use the binaries corresponding to your system architecture (`*.mexw64`, `*.mexa64`, or `*.mexmaci64`).
- If you wish to recompile the MEX binaries, refer to the `README.md` file inside the `KMAP_mex_files` folder for compilation instructions.

For example, to use the `kfit_2tcm.m` wrapper, you can call the function like this:

```matlab
[k, cfit] = kfit_2tcm(ct, cp, scant, k0, opt);
```

Ensure that the inputs are prepared according to the function specifications (refer to each functionâ€™s help documentation in MATLAB).

### Optional Settings (`opt`)

The `opt` structure used in these wrapper functions contains optional settings such as:

- `Decay`: Decay constant to be used in the model.
- `LowerBound`: Lower bounds for the parameters during optimization.
- `UpperBound`: Upper bounds for the parameters during optimization.
- `PrmSens`: A vector indicating which parameters are active during fitting.
- `MaxIter`: Maximum number of iterations for optimization.
- `TimeStep`: Time step to be used for numerical integration.

You can modify these settings by passing an `opt` structure when calling the wrapper functions. If no `opt` structure is provided, default values will be used.

### Error Handling

The wrapper functions check for NaN values, size mismatches between input data, and incorrect dimensions for scan times. If any of these issues are encountered, an error message will be displayed, and the fitting or TAC generation process will terminate.
