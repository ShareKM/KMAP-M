# Open Kinetic Modeling and Analysis Package (KMAP) Development Kit

## Overview

**C-KMAP** offers a collection of C/C++ source code and wrapper functions designed to implement and apply different tracer kinetic models for analyzing dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data, particularly for addressing the challenges emerging in total-body PET kinetic modeling. The primary objective of this open-source package is to provide kinetic modeling developers with a development kit to build upon without starting from scratch. The package is originally developed at the University of California, Davis. Its open-source version is initiated as a part of the [Open Kinetic Modeling Initiative (OpenKMI)](https://www.openkmi.org/).
